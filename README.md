# House-Price-Prediction-machine-learning-project
House price prediction is a task in the field of machine learning and data science aimed at estimating the market value of residential properties based on various factors. This predictive modeling task is valuable for real estate professionals, homeowners, investors, and policymakers, as it provides insights into property values and market trends.

The process typically involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as historical sales records, property features (e.g., size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location), economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, employment rates), and demographic information (e.g., population density, income levels).
